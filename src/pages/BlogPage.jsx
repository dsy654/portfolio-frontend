      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my blog! I'm a passionate computer science student and a self-taught developer. 
        My journey in the world of programming started with a simple "Hello, World!" in Python, and since then, 
        I've been captivated by the power and creativity of software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space is where I document my learning process, share solutions to problems I've encountered, 
        and reflect on my experiences with technologies like React, Node.js, and more. 
        I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and hope that my notes can be helpful to others on a similar path.
      </p>
